## Principle

**Only pay for what you need**: The Ribir don't have base object, everything is purely composed, such as `Margin`, if your application don't need `Margin`, you don't pay for `Margin` overhead.

**Only describe your data structure**:  In Ribir the interface is just the presentation around the data structure, not interfering with the data structure.

**Auto reactive to data notify**: The Ribir can automatically respond to changes reactive when the data relationships are established.
